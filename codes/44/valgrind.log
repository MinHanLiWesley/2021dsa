==33912== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==33912== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==33912== or are doing some strange experiment):
==33912==   /home/wesley/anaconda3/envs/download/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=33912 ...command...
==33912== 
==33912== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==33912==   /path/to/gdb ./main
==33912== and then give GDB the following command
==33912==   target remote | /home/wesley/anaconda3/envs/download/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=33912
==33912== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
